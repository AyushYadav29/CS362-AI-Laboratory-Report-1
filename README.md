* Week 2: To understand the use of Heuristic function for reducing the size of the search space.  Explore non-classical search algorithms for large problems.
* Week 3: Non-deterministic Search | Simulated Annealing For problems with large search spaces, randomized search becomes a meaningful option given partial/ full-information about the domain.  
* Week 4: Game Playing Agent | Minimax | Alpha-Beta Pruning Systematic adversarial search can lead to savings in terms of pruning of sub-trees resulting in lesser node evaluations
* Week 5: Understand the graphical models for inference under uncertainty, build Bayesian Network in R, Learn the structure and CPTs from Data, naive Bayes classification with dependency between features.
