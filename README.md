# CS362-AI-Laboratory-Report

* Week 1:To design a graph search agent and understand the use of a hash table, queue in state space search.
* Week 2: To understand the use of Heuristic function for reducing the size of the search space.  Explore non-classical search algorithms for large problems.
* Week 3: Non-deterministic Search | Simulated Annealing For problems with large search spaces, randomized search becomes a meaningful option given partial/ full-information about the domain.  
* Week 4: Game Playing Agent | Minimax | Alpha-Beta Pruning Systematic adversarial search can lead to savings in terms of pruning of sub-trees resulting in lesser node evaluations
* Week 5: Understand the graphical models for inference under uncertainty, build Bayesian Network in R, Learn the structure and CPTs from Data, naive Bayes classification with dependency between features.  
* Week 6: To implement Expectation Maximization routine for learning parameters of a Hidden Markov Model, to be able to use EM framework for deriving algorithms for problems with hidden or partial information.
* Week 8: Basics of data structure needed for state-space search tasks and use of random numbers required for MDP and RL
* Week 9: Understanding Exploitation - Exploration in simple n-arm bandit reinforcement learning task, epsilon-greedy algorithm
